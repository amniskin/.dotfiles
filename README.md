## .dotfiles
It's just a repo for my dot files.
I've got it set up so that I can just clone this to my home folder, execute the appropriate install script and realize all the ways my setup changed since the last time I updated the script. I jest. It gets me most of the way there and then I just update as appropriate (and when the desire strikes).
